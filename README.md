# spring_Hibernate_CRUD
This project aims to develop a Spring Hibernate application using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that performs basic CRUD operations on a database. The application will be built using the Spring Tool Suite (STS) IDE, which provides an integrated development environment for building, testing, and deploying Spring applications.

The application will use the following technologies:

Spring Framework: This provides a comprehensive framework for building enterprise applications using the Java programming language. It includes features such as dependency injection, AOP, and MVC architecture.

Hibernate ORM: This is a popular ORM framework that maps Java objects to database tables, and vice versa. It provides a simple API for performing basic CRUD operations on the database, and supports a wide range of databases.

MySQL Database: This will be used as the backend database for storing and retrieving data.

The application will be developed in a modular manner, with each module responsible for a specific functionality. The following modules will be developed:

Entity classes: These classes will represent the domain objects in the application, and will be mapped to database tables using Hibernate annotations.

DAO (Data Access Object) classes: These classes will provide methods for performing basic CRUD operations on the database using Hibernate.

Service classes: These classes will provide business logic for manipulating data, and will call the DAO classes to perform database operations.

Controller classes: These classes will handle user requests, call the appropriate service methods, and return the results to the user.

View classes: These classes will be responsible for rendering the data to the user in a web page.

The project will be built using Maven, which is a popular build tool for Java applications. It will also use Spring MVC architecture, which separates the application into three layers: Model, View, and Controller.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use Spring Hibernate ORM to perform basic CRUD operations on a database. It will also demonstrate how to use STS IDE to develop, test, and deploy a Spring application.
